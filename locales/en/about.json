    "text": "I am eager and full of enthusiasm for development as well as cooperation!  Every day I try to take a step forward to become better and better at what I do. In addition to being a current student of economics, I have a degree as an IT technician and certifications that I have obtained through courses in web programming. My favorite technologies when it comes to programming are NextJS and TypeScript. In addition to the technical stuff, I am also a lover of mathematics from which I tutor. In my free time I like to spend time outdoors (bike, badminton), read books or listen to podcasts  "
